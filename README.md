# gomoku

- ## What is it?

    It is a simple board game named Gomoku, also called Five in a Row. It is an abstract strategy board game, and it is traditionally played with black and white stones. Players alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. White plays first. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

- ## Why did I make it?

    I had decided to build the Pac-Man game Using HTML, CSS, and JS for my first project. But my coach recommended a simple game as I had to learn everything along with the project. So, we decided to build a simple board game named Gomoku, also called Five in a Row.
    
- ## What is next?

    Currently, to play the game there should be two players. I would like to implement the PC as one of the players. So the game could be played even with one player at a time.
