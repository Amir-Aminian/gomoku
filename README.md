- ## why did I make it?

    I had decided to build the Pac-Man game Using HTML, CSS, and JS for my first project. But my coach recommended a simple game as I had to learn everything along with the project. So, we decided to build a simple board game named Gomoku, also called Five in a Row. Everything went very smoothly, and I learned a lot each time I faced a problem. I enjoyed building a whole project on my own, and I hope you also have a little fun playing it.
Please let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions for improvements to my project.
